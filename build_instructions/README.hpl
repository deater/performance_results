Just some directions on how I am running these experiments, in case
anyone wants to try to replicate.

Most of my systems run debian.  From a fairly stock debian install you
will need to install the following packages:

apt-get install libmpich-dev (might be libmpich2-dev on older systems)
apt-get install gfortran

Next, get and install OpenBlas.  You can get the git tree, but usually
I'll get the most recent stable release tarball.
	http://www.openblas.net/

Untar it, then usually it's just a matter of "make".  If you have unusual
hardware you might have to specify the architecture by hand.
On a slow machine (like a pi) it might take a few hours to build.

Next get hpl.  Hpl is notriously a pain to get built.  I'll do the following:
	Download from here:
		http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/
	I have been using hpl-2.1

	Untar it.

	Make a Make.OpenBLAS config file.  I've included mine here,
	but note your paths might have to be adjusted.

	Make a link to the hpl-1.2 directory from hpl in your home directory.
	I'm not sure why but it always fails if I don't do this.

		cd ; ln -s PATH_TO_HPL hpl

	Run "make arch=OpenBLAS"

	And if all went well, it will generate a file
		./bin/OpenBLAS/xhpl

	Next copy in a good HPL.dat file to use.  The one I used
	is included in the results directory for each machine I ran on.
	You will likely want to edit the N line to match.

	Then just run "xhpl" and you will be good.
