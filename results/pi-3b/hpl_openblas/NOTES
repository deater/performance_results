note on my pi3, even with a small heatsink, using N=8000 and higher
results in failed results and sometimes locked systems.

The results also are lower than expected due to CPU throttling.

Lockups can be avoided by passing
	overvolt=2
in the config.txt file and rebooting, but usually in this case
without heatsink/fan the processor will still throttle down to
600MHz and return much lower results.

for more info.

There it is reported a GFLOPS of 6.4 could be obtained with proper cooling.
