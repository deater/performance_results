A pain!

Make sure 32-bit gcc etc installed

Download and install
	cuda-repo-l4t-r23.1-7-0-local_7.0-71_armhf.deb
from nvidia

you're supposed to then be able to do "apt-get update / apt get install cuda"
but didn't work for me, had to manually install cublas, cublas-dev,
cudart-dev, cuda-command-line-tools-7-0, etc from /var/cuda-repo-7-0-local

Use the included Make.CUDA with hpl-cuda

Need to manually install mpich as Ubunty Trusty doesn't package it?
	mpich-3.2
	configure, make, make install

	compile openblas.  git (2.18?)

Put the cudablas path in /etc/ld.so.conf.d


You might thin you want to install Jetson Drivers
	JetPack-L4T-2.0-linux-x64.run
	But that's just tools that let you (on an x86_64 machine)
	flash the jetson over USB, and even then you have to
	be running a very specific version of Ubuntu.


Trying to run hpl_cuda and it either crashes the machine or isn't
using CUDA at all.  Frustrating.  Did get some results but they
might just be CPU.
